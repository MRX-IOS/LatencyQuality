# LatencyQuality

## Description

LatencyQuality is a project that focuses on measuring Quality of Service (QoS) from the client side. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to analyze and evaluate various aspects of network performance that directly impact the end-user experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The project offers real-time monitoring capabilities to capture and measure key QoS metrics, such as latency, packet loss, and bandwidth utilization, from the client side.

- **Customizable Test Scenarios**: Users can configure and customize test scenarios to simulate different network conditions, traffic patterns, and load levels, allowing for accurate assessment of QoS in various environments.

- **Performance Analysis**: The project provides in-depth performance analysis to identify and diagnose network bottlenecks, latency spikes, and other issues affecting the QoS from the client's perspective.

- **Alerting and Notifications**: Users can set up customized alerts and notifications based on predefined thresholds, enabling timely identification and response to potential QoS degradation.

- **Historical Data and Reporting**: LatencyQuality stores historical data and generates detailed reports, graphs, and visualizations to track QoS trends over time, facilitating comprehensive analysis and decision-making.

## Getting Started
